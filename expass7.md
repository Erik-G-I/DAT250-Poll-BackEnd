## Report
When running building the docker image it is important to expose the port to the system so you can run HTTP requests to it.

For this i used `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 expass7`

The jpa-tutorial passed its tests locally when the correct docker container was running

It took some time to get familiar with docker, but i think i got a baisc understanding of it in the end.
